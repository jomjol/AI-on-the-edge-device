# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [13.0.7] 2022-12-11

**Home Assistant MQTT Discovery Support**

### Update Procedure

:bangbang: **Make sure to read the instructions below carfully!**

1.  Backup your configuration (use the `System -> Backup/Restore` page)!

2.  You should update to `12.0.1` before you update to this release. All other migrations are untested. 

3.  Upload and update the `update-*.zip` file from this release.

4.  Let it restart and check on the `System -> Info` page that the Firmware as well as the Web UI got updated. If only one got updated, redo the update. If it fails several times, you also can update the Firmware and the Web UI separately.

5.  Safe way: 
    1.  Update first the `firmware.bin` (extract from zip file) and do the Reboot
    2.  Update with the full zip file (`update-*.zip`, ignore the version warning after the reboot)

6.  Please go to `Settings -> Configuration` and address the changed parameters:
    -   DataLogging (storing the values for data graph)
    -   Debug (extended by different debug reporting levels)

7.  Make sure it starts to do the digitalization (check the Error field on the overview page). If it does not start a round within a minute, restart the device.

If anything breaks you can try to enforce manual update as following:

**OTA:**
  1. Make sure the last run of the update completed the **Uploading** step.
  1. Call `http://<IP>/ota?task=update&file=<UPLOAD_FILENAME>` to enforce the extraction/flashing.

**Initial Setup:**
  1. Use the initial_esp32_setup.zip ( <https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/wiki/Installation> ) as alternative to have a clean install.

### Added

-   Implementation of [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery)
-   Improved ROIs configuration: locked ROI geometry, equidistant delta x
-   Improved OTA Update mechanism (only working after installation for next update)
-   Added data logging in `/log/data` - One day per file and each measurement is on one line
    -   Format: csv - comma separated
    -   Content: `time`, `name-of-number`, `raw-value`, `return-value`, `pre-value`, `change-rate`, `change-absolute`, `error-text`, `cnn-digital`, `cnn-analog`

### Removed

-   n.a.

## [12.0.1] 2022-09-29

Improve **u**ser e**x**perience 

:bangbang: The release breaks a few things in ota update :bangbang:

**Make sure to read the instructions below carfully!**.

1.  Backup your configuration (use the `System > Backup/Restore` page)!
2.  You should update to `11.3.1` before you update to this release. All other migrations are not tested. 
    Rolling newer than `11.3.1` can also be used, but no guaranty.
3.  Upload and update the `firmware.bin` file from this release. **but do not reboot**
4.  Upload the `html-from-11.3.1.zip` in html upload and update the web interface.
5.  Now you can reboot.

If anything breaks you can try to
1. Call `http://<IP>/ota?task=update&file=firmware.bin` resp. `http://<IP>/ota?task=update&file=html.zip` if the upload successed but the extraction failed.
1. Use the initial_esp32_setup.zip ( <https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/wiki/Installation> ) as alternative.

### Added

-   Automatic release creation
-   Newest firmware of rolling branch now automatically build and provided in [Github Actions Output](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/actions) (developers only)
-   [#1068](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/1068) New update mechanism: 
    -   Handling of all files (`zip`, `tfl`, `tflite`, `bin`) within in one common update interface
    -   Using the `update.zip` from the [Release page](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/releases)
    -   Status (`upload`, `processing`, ...) displayed on Web Interface
    -   Automatical detection and suggestion for reboot where needed (Web Interface uupdates only need a page refresh)
    -   :bangbang: Best for OTA use Firefox. Chrome works with warnings. Safari stuck in upload.

### Changed

-   Integrated version info better shown on the Info page and in the log
-   Updated menu
-   Update used libraries (`tflite`, `esp32-cam`, `esp-nn`, as of 20220924) 

### Fixed

-   [#1092](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/1092) censor passwords in log outputs 
-   [#1029](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/1029) wrong change of `checkDigitConsistency` now working like releases before `11.3.1` 
-   Spelling corrections (**[cristianmitran](https://github.com/cristianmitran)**) 

### Removed

-   Remove the folder `/firmware` from GitHub repository. 
    If you want to get the latest `firmware.bin` and `html.zip` files, please download from the automated [build action](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/actions) or [release page](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/releases)

Intermediate Digits

-   **ATTENTION**: 

    -   first update the `firmware.bin` and ensure that the new version is running

    -   Only afterwards update the `html.zip`

    -   Otherwise the downwards compatibility of the new counter clockwise feature is not given and you end in a reboot loop, that needs manual flashing!

## [10.3.0] - (2022-01-29)

Stability Increase

### Changed

-   Implemented LED flash dimming (`LEDIntensity`).
    Remark: as auto illumination in the camera is used, this is rather for energy saving. It will not help reducing reflections
-   Additional camera parameters: saturation, contrast (although not too much impact yet)
-   Some readings will have removable "N"s that can not be removed automatically and are handled with an "error" --> no return value in the field "value" anymore (still reported back via field "raw value")
-   Updated esp32 camera hardware driver
-   Bug fix: MQTT, HTML improvements

**ATTENTION:  The new ESP32 camera hardware driver is much more stable on newer OV2640 versions (no or much less reboots) but seems to be not fully compatible with older versions.**

If you have problem with stalled systems you can try the following

-   Update the parameter `ImageQuality` to `12` instead of current value `5` (manually in the `config.ini`)

-   If this is not helping, you might need to update your hardware or stay with version 9.2

## [10.2.0] - (2022-01-14)

Stability Increase

### Changed

-   Due to the updated camera driver, the image looks different and a new setup might be needed

    -   Update reference image
    -   Update Alignment marks

-   Reduce reboot due to camera problems

-   Update esp32-camera to new version (master as of 2022-01-09)

## [10.1.1] - (2022-01-12)

 Stability Increase

### Changed

-   Bug Fix MQTT problem
-   Issue:
    -   Changing from v9.x to 10.x the MQTT-parameter "Topic" was renamed into "MainTopic" to address multiple number meters. This renaming should have been done automatically in the background within the graphical configuration, but was not working. Instead the parameter "Topic" was deleted and "MainTopic" was set to disabled and "undefined".
-   ToDo
    -   Update the `html.zip`
    -   If old `config.ini` available: copy it to `/config`, open the graphical configuration and save it again.
    -   If old `config.ini` not available: reset the parameter "MainTopic" within the `config.ini` manually
    -   Reboot
