# Parameter `DataLogActive`
Default Value: `true`
Activate data logging to the SD-Card.

The files will be stored in `/log/data/data_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`. See [`Data Logging`](../data-logging) for details.

!!! Warning
    A SD-Card has limited write cycles. Since the device does not do [Wear Leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling), this can wear out your SD-Card!
