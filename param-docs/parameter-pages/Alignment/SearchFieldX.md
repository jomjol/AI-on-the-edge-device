# Parameter `SearchFieldX`
Default Value: `20`

Unit: Pixels

!!! Warning
    This is an **Expert Parameter**! Only change it if you understand what it does!

X-size (width) in which the reference is searched.

!!! Note
     Since the alignment is one of the steps using a lot of computation time, 
     the search field should be as small as possible.
     The calculation time goes quadratic with the search field size.
