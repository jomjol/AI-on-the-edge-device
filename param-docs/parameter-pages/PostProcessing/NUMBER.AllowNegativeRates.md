# Parameter `AllowNegativeRates`
Default Value: `false`

Allow a meter to count backwards (decreasing values).

!!! Note
    This is unusual (it means there is a negative rate) and not wanted in most cases!

!!! Note
    This parameter must be prefixed with `<NUMBER>` followed by a dot (eg. `main.AllowNegativeRates`). `<NUMBER>` is the name of the number sequence  defined in the ROI's.
