# Parameter `CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency`
Default Value: `false`

!!! Warning
    This is an **Expert Parameter**! Only change it if you understand what it does!

An additional consistency check.
It especially improves the zero crossing check between digits.

!!! Note
    If you edit the config file manually, you must prefix this parameter with `<NUMBER>` followed by a dot (eg. `main.CheckDigitIncreaseConsistency`). The reason is that this parameter is specific for each `<NUMBER>` (`<NUMBER>` is the name of the number sequence defined in the ROI's).
