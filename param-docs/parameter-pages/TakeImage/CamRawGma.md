!!! Note
    The main purpose of the Gamma (GMA) function is to compensate for the non-linear characteristics of the sensor. GMA
    converts the pixel values according to the Gamma curve to compensate the sensor output under different light strengths.
    The non-linear gamma curve is approximately constructed with different linear functions. Raw gamma compensates the
    image in the RAW domain.

Enable/Disable raw gamma mode.
