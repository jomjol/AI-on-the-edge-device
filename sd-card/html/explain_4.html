<h4>Define Digits</h4>
Here you define your analog counters you want to read. If you have more than one number on the reading you can define several numbers with the <b>"Number"</b> selector. There you can also define new numbers. If you do not have analog counters delete all ROIs.
<p>
    With the drop down menue <b>"ROI x"</b> you can change between the different counters. Mark them with the mouse or the coordinates.
    <br>
    To create new ROIs use <b>"New ROIs"</b>. The order of the ROIs defines the positon within the reading. <br>
    You can change it with <b>"move Next" / "move Previous"</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget to save your changes with <b>"Save all to Config.ini"</b>! A reboot is not yet required.
