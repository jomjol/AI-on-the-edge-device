## Build the project yourself

- download and install VS Code
- install the VS Code platform io plugin
- git clone this project
- in VS code, open the `AI-on-the-edge-device/code` 
	- from terminal: `cd AI-on-the-edge-device/code && code .`
- open a pio terminal (click on the terminal sign in the bottom menu bar)
- make sure you are in the `code` directory
- To build, type  `pio build`	 
	- the build artifacts are stored in `code/.pio/build/esp32cam/`
- Connect the device and type `pio device monitor`. There you will see your device and can copy the name to the next instruction
- Add `upload_port = you_device_port` to the `platformio.ini` file
- make sure an sd card with the contents of the `sd_card` folder is inserted and you have changed the wifi details
- `pio run --target erase` to erase the flash
- `pio run --target upload` this will upload the `bootloader.bin, partitions.bin,firmware.bin` from the `code/.pio/build/esp32cam/` folder. 
- `pio device monitor` to observe the logs via uart
